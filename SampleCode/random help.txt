installing packages with pip -
 - for <= python 2.7:  pip install _____  (___ is package name)
 - for >= python 3.0:  pip3 install _____  (___ is package name)
 - to find the package name (for importing in scripts), run a python
   window (python or python3/py). This runs the command line-like version
   of the python you chose. Then, type help(‘modules’). This will create a
   list of all modules available to you. Most likely, the modules you installed
   is just all in lower case (ie. PyMySQL -> pymysql).
   Try “pip show —-files ‘packagename’” to find the import key for the installed
   module. Most likely the folder name that source files are in.

Append path to sys.path to be able to import files. For an example, see Misc. Project Info/dir
>> import sys
## sys.path.append(“__PROJECT_PATH__”)
>> sys.path.append(“/Users/peterwalker/Documents/School/+CSUMB Courses+/CST 499_Capstone/CSUMB-Capstone-Iperf-Parser”)
